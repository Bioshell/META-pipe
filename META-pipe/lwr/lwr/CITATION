To cite the LWR in publications, please use:

...wait the LWR is unpublished. I guess just use the bitbucket URL for
now.

I do hope to work on an LWR publication in the next couple months
however, though I am completely clueless about how to approach
this. If you have any advice on this please help me out.

Should I do a application focused methods paper on some Galaxy-P tools
that would not otherwise be usable in Galaxy without the LWR geared at
proteomics researchers, should I do a short application note about the
technical aspects of the LWR? Both? Combine concepts into one paper
with two audiences?  What journal(s) should I target? Thanks!
